We use this to check the current state of the [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), [Hermes](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/) and [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-protocol) projects.

Open up your prefered IDE, like vscode and run the following line in the terminal:

export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your token>
npm install
npm run dev
